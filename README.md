# üéâ **Features**

Multiple features of Prismic are used in this starter:

- **Slices**: Enrich your blogposts with custom quotes, images or codeblocks. You can order them how you like. When you used the¬†*Image-Slice*¬†the image will get inserted and optimized by¬†**gatsby-image**

# üíª¬†Quick start

1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

   Use the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/) to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

   ```bash
   npm install -g gatsby-cli

   # create a new Gatsby site using this starter
   gatsby new <name> https://github.com/iamsainikhil/gatsby-prismic-blog-starter
   ```

2. **Install the packages**

   Install the packages using the command `npm install`

3. **Environment File**

   - Go to _API & Security_ section of your _Prismic_ project, grab the Permanent Access Token with _Access to master/README_images_.
   - The Repository Name is the name you have entered at the creation of the repository (you‚Äôll also find it as the subdomain in the URL)
   - This project has the support for [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/) comments section which need your DISQUS project name which can be found at _https://<your-project-shortname>.disqus.com/admin/settings/general/_
   - Create an `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Add the following properties in it:

   ```json
    GA_ID=<your Google Analytics tracking ID> (Optional)

    GATSBY_PRISMIC_REPOSITORY_NAME=<your prismic repository name> (Required)

    PRISMIC_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your prismic permanent access token> (Required)

    GATSBY_DISQUS_NAME=<your disqus project shortname> (Required)

    GATSBY_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 (Optional to disable GATSBY analytics)
   ```

4. **Start developing.**

   Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

   ```bash
   # Go to project directory
   cd <name>

   # start the application
   npm run start
   ```

5. **Troubleshooting**

   If the application start process got stuck, just kill the process and restart the application.

   > **Known issue**: _Gatsby develop process sometimes get stuck at onPostBootstrap process. When this happens, just kill and restart the app. For more info, check [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/25216)._

6. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at¬†`http://localhost:8000`!

   \_Note: You'll also see a second link:¬†`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the¬†[Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).\_

   Open the¬†`<name>`¬†directory in your code editor of choice and edit¬†`gatsby-config.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

# ‚öôÔ∏è Available Scripts

---

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.Open¬†`[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:3000/)`¬†to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint or gatsby develop errors in the console.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about

**[running tests](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/unit-testing/)** for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the¬†`build`¬†folder.It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about¬†**[deployment](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/overview-of-the-gatsby-build-process/)**¬†for more information.

`npm format`

Formats the app files like _js, jsx, json, and md_ using Prettier. You can learn more about the format **[here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html)**.

# ‚öì Prismic Webhook

Prismic Webhook allows you to automatically or manually trigger a deployment process in Netlify or Vercel if any post is published or unpublished OR for other events in Prismic. I use Vercel as the example and I guess it might be quite similar for Netlify or any other cloud service.

## Steps:

- Create a Deploy Hook in Vercel [here](https://vercel.com/iamsainikhil/gatsby-prismic-blog-starter/settings/git-integration). For more info, check [here](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/more/deploy-hooks)

![deploy_hook_vercel](https://github.com/iamsainikhil/gatsby-prismic-blog-starter/raw/master/README_images/deploy_hook_vercel.png)

- Copy the hook link and past in the URL section of the prismic Webhook
- Create a Prismic Webhook [here](https://iamsainikhil-blog.prismic.io/settings/webhooks/). For more info, check [here](https://user-guides.prismic.io/en/articles/790505-webhooks). -

![prismic_webhook](https://github.com/iamsainikhil/gatsby-prismic-blog-starter/raw/master/README_images/prismic_webhook.png)

- The `Secret` field is _optional_ in the Prismic Webhook. If you set it, Prismic will send the content to your server, so that you can verify that the request is coming from prismic.io.
- After successful creation of the Webhook, you can manually trigger it and can also see the logs.

![prismic_webhoks](https://github.com/iamsainikhil/gatsby-prismic-blog-starter/raw/master/README_images/prismic_webhooks.png)

> You can create any number of Webhooks for a prismic project!

# üôè Acknowledgements

Special thanks to [Kyle Mathews](https://github.com/KyleAMathews) & [Lennart](https://github.com/LekoArts) for creating respective gatsby based starter templates from which I gained a lot of knowledge and developed this template.

Orginally this starter was started using this [one](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).

PS: If you need to develop a customizable whole webiste using Gatsby & Prismic, I recommend you to check this [template](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-prismic) created by Lennart.
